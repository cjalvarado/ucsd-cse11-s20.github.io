<b>This web site is under constant revision until the start of the quarter.</b>

In this course, you will learn to write, trace, and test programs; explore the
interactions between programs and data; and practice organizing programs for
clarity and re-use.

We will explore these topics interactively in lecure, you will implement
programs to practice your programming skills, and you will reflect on this
learning through your own program designs.

This web page serves as the main source of announcements and resources for the
course, as well as the syllabus.

## Basics

- Podcasts: [Coming Soon]
- Q&A Forum: [Coming Soon]
- Gradescope: [https://www.gradescope.com](https://www.gradescope.com) [an invitation will be sent in the first week]
- Readings/quizzes/drill assignments: [Coming Soon]

On an average week in CSE11, you can expect to spend 4-6 hours on videos,
reading, lecture, and discussion; 2-3 hours on programming practice; and 4-6
hours working on your programming projects. If you find yourself spending
dramatically more time than this, it's a good idea to contact the course staff
and discuss more efficient strategies in office hours.

<h3>Lecture</h3>

Most lecture content will be presented asynchronously through videos and
readings. These will come with associated quizzes that are due on Tuesday and
Thursday at the start of our originally-scheduled lecture time. The quizzes are
required work to demonstrate your consistent engagement with the material.

In our originally-scheduled lecture time, we will have synchronous discussions
that will be a mix of Q&A and breakout groups working on specific problems
designed to prompt useful discussion. Attendance is encouraged by not required.
Recordings of relevant classwide discussions will be posted after the meetings,
though small group discussions may not be posted.

This is essentially a flipped classroom with the class discussion part
delivered remotely.

The scheduled lecture time is (in the time zone of San Diego) Tuesday and
Thursday from 11am-12:30pm. You can visit the lectures via:

<h3>Discussion Sections</h3>

Discussion sections will be used to demo tools and answer questions about the
programming assignment specifications. They will be recorded and released, also
have similar discussion prompts and breakout groups to work on problems.
Attendance is encouraged but optional. The discussions are (in the time zone of
San Diego) at [FILL]. You can visit the discussions at:

<h3>Schedule</h3>
The schedule below outlines topics, due dates, and links to assignments. In a typical week, by 5pm Monday before class all due dates, readings, and notable events in the course until the following week will be posted here. So if you check the schedule at the beginning of the week, you'll know when all reading quizzes, programming assignments, etc. will be due. We will often have the schedule confirmed more than a week out, but we'll always be at least a week ahead.

## Staff & Resources

### Staff

There are 10 staff(instructor, TAs, and tutors) to help with your learning, and a few kinds of help session
you can attend. 
<iframe src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSHcR4l04Pfe8mEBjKeNC_zlCtu7bVwN0uJuJxqlNHjpGWLZFFepkILjeG6xqDrlFJsvcWnJ8Ru3gYn/pubhtml?gid=0&amp;single=true&amp;widget=true&amp;headers=false" width="100%" height="500px"></iframe>

The first is group help hours at the times listed below. Group help hours are a great place for any kind of question about the course, from help with your assignment to clarifications about material in lecture to questions beyond what we cover in the course.

The second is 1-on-1 help hours where tutors are available to answer your questions about any course content, though often this is a good place to go for programming help. At the times below, the course staff will be available to answer your questions. You can use https://autograder.ucsd.edu to request help by filing a help ticket and a tutor will come to help. This system keeps track of a queue of help requests and we help out on a first-come, first-served basis. 

That said, there are some important rules for asking for help.
You must give a specific, actionable request in your help ticket. If your ticket simply says “I'm stuck,” we will remove the ticket from the queue with a response that urges you to be more specific. It's OK to ask questions if you're not sure what you're supposed to be doing on an assignment.
You must list at least one specific thing you tried in order to resolve the problem on your own, or a guess at your understanding of what you should be doing if you're lost.

Tutors can help you understand your problem and a useful approach. They cannot solve your problems for you or do the programming for you. It could happen that you're still stuck even after getting tutor help, and that's OK! You can always work the problem on your own, come to office hours for a different perspective, or come back to the problem (even after the deadline).
These rules help us make sure we get timely and actionable help to as many students as possible. They also encourage students to do some meaningful work on their own before reaching out for help – the goal of the course is for you to be able to do programming work on your own!
