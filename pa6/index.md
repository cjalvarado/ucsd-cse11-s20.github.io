# PA6 -- Programming Workflow

<p style="border: 2px dotted red; padding: 1em;">
This is a draft, this notice will be removed when the PA is finalized.
</p>


This PA will give you an opportunity to reflect on how you work through
programs.

You will also submit a survey (required) about your experience in the course.

## Task

Make a copy of this Google Doc (link). You will fill it in as you work.

<div class='sidenote'>If your living/working situation doesn't afford you 90
minutes of uninterrupted time, feel free to break up the timed chunks. Do
your best to do something like 25 minutes with 5 minutes of notes three
times and follow the spirit of the assignment.</div>
Set aside 90 continuous uninterrupted minutes for this task.

You will write a method called `averagePositives` that takes an array of
`double` and produces a `double`. It should produce the average (mean) of the
numbers in the array that are strictly greater than 0. If there are no
numbers in the array that are greater than 0, it should produce 0.

Write six tests for this method that convince you it works for all of the
important cases.

Set a timer for 25 minutes – work on this task for that much time. Then, take
a screenshot or copy/paste your code and the output of the most recent time
you did `./run`. Put that output into the Google Doc at the 25 minute mark,
and write down 2-3 sentences about your thought process at this point – don't
spend more than 5 minutes on the notes. Also note if you got distracted (you
don't have to tell us how) by another browser tab, your phone, etc during
that 25 minutes. Just say yes/no and how many minutes you think you were
distracted for.

Set another 25 minute timer and work for another 25 minutes, then repeat
taking notes. Then do this one more time, for a total of 3 25-minute sessions
each followed by note-taking.

If you don't finish the task, still stop after 90 minutes and put the notes
in place. It's up to you if you want to complete it, you just have to submit
your notes document and the reflection below.

If you finish early, note the time you finished.

## Reflection

After you're done with the 90 minutes, reflect on the following:

- Where did you spend the most time? You might have different descriptions,
some I can think of that I spend a lot of time on are below; you might have
others.
  - Thinking about a particular part of the program
  - Understanding an error message
  - Figuring out why a particular test wasn't working
  - Typing
- What could you do to reduce the time taken in the future?
- How did this process compare to how you usually complete PAs?
- Overall, what did you learn from this experience about your programming
workflow, if anything?

## Submission

Export your notes document as a PDF using Google Docs (under the File menu).
You'll hand it in under the `pa6` assignment on Gradescope. There is no
autograder or separate code submission for this assignment.
